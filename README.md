#Airplane!

This is the third-week challenge at Makers Academy:

The challenge is to write software to control the flow of planes at an airport. Planes should start off flying and be able to land, when their status will change to landed. The planes can then take off, but only if the weather is nice. Also, if there are strong winds, planes are not permitted to land or take off. The weather is to be created randomly.

The airport has a limited number of runways, so when they are all full all the planes landed at the aiport must take off. Once the planes are in the air, they must have a flying status.
